Elaborate on the formulas used reference + numbers meaning
Figure 2:   What if we used semilogy
            Take only A2G: 10, 100, 145, 280
            Multiple line styles
Figure 3: Increased font size
            Move legend from covering the lines
            G2G: UE-RN RN-BS
            If too many figures
            For low snr noise is dominant so capacity is not deeply affected
            while for high snr fading starts having an effect

FCFS, EDF, Priority: Try to draw flowcharts
Examples of where they are used in applications

Figure 5 -> split to two figures with a, b, c
Add insight into why EDF is in the middle for instance
ADD AVERAGE WAIT TIMES AND DROP RATES

aggregate packet arrivals* -> aggregate packet
NO TITLE ON TOP OF FIGURES
Always below
Add markers for each discrete point

Figure 11 drop rate, clean it to show trend
OR DROP IT COMPLETELY AS IT GIVES NO ADDITIONAL INSIGHT


Elaborate more on the trend

Figure 14 try to merge them

Try to explicitly link the capacity in Figure 10 to other Figures
